To enable quick summarization shortcuts and integrations, you can set up API access as follows:

1. **Go to App Settings:**
   - Navigate to the app settings page in your account dashboard.
2. **Create an API Key:**
   - In the settings, find the section for API Keys and generate a new key.
3. **Use the API Key:**
   - When using the shortcut or integration, paste your API key in the field labeled `API Token`.
   - This token will authenticate your requests to the API endpoint.

**Example Usage:**

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key you generated, and `YOUR_CONTENT` with the text or URL you want to summarize.
